# SAP Community Coding Challenge #3

#### Hello ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the third challenge in the SAP Community Coding Challenge Series!
Please find instructions to the challenge [here]()

There are multiple ways to share your solution with us. If you choose to share a
 GitHub link for your solution, please remember to either [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
 or [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
 this repo to use it as a starting point.
 
If you like to keep your repo [private](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-repository-visibility),
 please make sure to add me (username `antheajung`) as a [collaborator](https://help.github.jp/enterprise/2.11/user/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/)
 to your personal repository.

Please remember that forking the repo or adding me as a collaborator **DOES NOT** automatically enter you into the challenge.
 Please make sure to follow the [submission instructions]() to be considered as a valid participant. 

This repo is only to be used as a starting point and is valid to change the project structure if necessary.

### GLHF: Good Luck and Have Fun! ðŸŽ‰
